# Legacy Code

This directory contains the original code that served as the foundation for the SecuriScan project. These files are preserved for historical reference and are no longer actively used in the project.

## Files

- `website_security_assessment.py` - The original monolithic script that performed basic website security assessments
- `website_security_assessment_colab.ipynb` - A Google Colab notebook that provided a web interface for the script

## Why These Files Are Archived

The original code has been completely refactored and expanded into a comprehensive, professional-grade security scanning framework. The new architecture offers several improvements:

1. **Modular Design**: The monolithic script has been split into well-organized modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Extensibility**: The new framework allows for easy addition of new scanner modules
3. **Improved Reporting**: Enhanced reporting capabilities with multiple output formats
4. **Professional Features**: Added CI/CD, Docker support, comprehensive documentation, and proper package management
5. **Better Testing**: Proper test infrastructure with pytest, tox, and GitHub Actions
6. **Maintainability**: Code follows best practices with type hints, documentation, and consistent style

## Relationship to Current Project

The current SecuriScan project builds upon the concepts and functionality in these legacy files, but with a complete architectural redesign. The core scanning capabilities have been preserved and enhanced, while the overall structure has been rebuilt from the ground up to support professional use cases.

These files are kept as a reference to show the project's evolution and to acknowledge the foundation upon which the current project is built.
