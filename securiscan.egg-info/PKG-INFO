**SecuriScan** is a professional web security testing framework designed to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers to assess the security posture of web applications.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Security Scanning**: Detect common web vulnerabilities including OWASP Top 10
- **Passive Scanning**: Analyze websites without sending potentially harmful requests
- **Active Scanning**: Perform thorough security testing with configurable intensity levels
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor websites for security issues over time
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, CSV, PDF)
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add custom scanners and modules
- **Command-line Interface**: Powerful CLI for automation and integration
- **Programmatic API**: Use as a library in your Python applications

```bash
pip install securiscan
```

### With Optional Dependencies

```bash
# For browser automation
pip install securiscan[browser]

# For PDF report generation
pip install securiscan[pdf]

# For development
pip install securiscan[dev]

# For documentation

```

## Quick Start

### Command-line Usage

```bash
# Basic scan
securiscan scan https://example.com

# Scan with specific level
securiscan scan --level aggressive https://example.com

# Save report
securiscan scan --output report.html https://example.com

# Continuous monitoring
securiscan monitor --interval 24 https://example.com

# List available scanner modules
securiscan list-modules
```

### Python API Usage

```python
from securiscan import Scanner, ScanConfig, ScanLevel

# Create scanner with custom configuration
config = ScanConfig(
    scan_level=ScanLevel.STANDARD,
    max_depth=3,
    threads=10,
    timeout=30,
)

# Create scanner
scanner = Scanner(config)

# Run scan
result = scanner.scan("https://example.com")

# Print vulnerabilities
for vuln in result.vulnerabilities:
    print(f"[{vuln.severity}] {vuln.name}: {vuln.description}")

# Generate report
result.generate_report("report.html", "html")
```
