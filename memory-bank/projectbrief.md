# SecuriScan Project Brief

## Project Overview

SecuriScan is a professional web security testing framework designed to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers to assess the security posture of web applications.

## Core Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Security Scanning**: Detect common web vulnerabilities including OWASP Top 10
2. **Passive Scanning**: Analyze websites without sending potentially harmful requests
3. **Active Scanning**: Perform thorough security testing with configurable intensity levels
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor websites for security issues over time
5. **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, CSV, PDF)
6. **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add custom scanners and modules
7. **Command-line Interface**: Powerful CLI for automation and integration
8. **Programmatic API**: Use as a library in Python applications

## Target Audience

- Security professionals
- Penetration testers
- Web developers
- DevOps engineers
- Security researchers
- System administrators

## Key Features

### Security Scanning

- **Passive Scanning**: Analyze HTTP responses without sending potentially harmful requests
  - Security headers analysis
  - SSL/TLS configuration analysis
  - Content analysis
  - Technology detection

- **Active Scanning**: Perform thorough security testing with configurable intensity levels
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection
  - Directory and file bruteforcing
  - SQL Injection detection
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) detection
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) detection
  - XML External Entity (XXE) detection
  - Command Injection detection
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI) detection
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI) detection
  - Insecure Deserialization detection
  - Broken Authentication detection
  - Broken Access Control detection

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Scheduled Scanning**: Run scans at regular intervals
- **Change Detection**: Detect changes in security posture
- **Alerting**: Send notifications when issues are detected
- **Historical Reporting**: Track security posture over time

### Reporting

- **Multiple Formats**: Generate reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and PDF formats
- **Customizable Templates**: Customize report templates
- **Vulnerability Details**: Provide detailed information about vulnerabilities
- **Remediation Guidance**: Provide guidance on how to fix vulnerabilities
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risk of vulnerabilities

### Integration

- **Command-line Interface**: Powerful CLI for automation and integration
- **Programmatic API**: Use as a library in Python applications
- **Docker Support**: Run in Docker containers
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully detect common web vulnerabilities
2. Provide accurate and actionable information about vulnerabilities
3. Minimize false positives and false negatives
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for security testing
5. Generate comprehensive and customizable reports
6. Support integration with other tools and workflows
7. Maintain a high level of code quality and test coverage
8. Provide comprehensive documentation

## Constraints

1. Must be compatible with Python 3.8 and above
2. Must be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
3. Must be open-source under the MIT License
4. Must follow ethical security testing practices
5. Must respect website terms of service and robots.txt
6. Must not perform denial-of-service attacks
7. Must not exploit vulnerabilities without explicit permission

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Core framework and passive scanning capabilities
2. **Phase 2**: Active scanning capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Continuous monitoring capabilities
4. **Phase 4**: Reporting and integration capabilities
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation and testing
